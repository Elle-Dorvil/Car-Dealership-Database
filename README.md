Car Dealership Database

## Description of the Project

The Car Dealership Database is designed to manage the core operations of a vehicle dealership network. 
It stores and organizes information about vehicles, dealerships, inventory, sales contracts, and lease agreements. 
This relational schema enables easy tracking of vehicle status, dealership assignments, and customer transactions.

## Demo
USE DEALERSHIP_DATABASE;
SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE vin = "1C4RJFBG7JC123321";

-- This code finds and shows full details of one specific car based on its unique VIN.
